Since I came out of college, I've been meaning start some kind of blog -- something that I would to blurb out an array of different thoughts (oh wait, Twitter's there for that) or to document major technical learnings and obstacles in my career -- maybe something like the Medium posts from devs who do deep dives on technologies and frameworks like ReactiveSwift.

Now that I've finally kicked off a polished version of this site up and running, I figure that this might be a good opportunity for me get that blog going. Maybe I can even improve my technical writing skills and reinforce my learnings on all sorts of topics

Anyways. I'll probably using this blog to explore and blurb out thoughts on my experience with different books, technologies, or quirks of what I'm run into -- a journal of my experiences more than anything. Will probably post something.
