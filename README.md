# Don's Portfolio Site

## About

This is the source code for my personal site. 

## Directory Structure
All code and assets in the `/docs` folder is configured to be deployed on each commit to the `main` branch.


## Developing
This site is to be integrated [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

### Setup
See the Jekyll installation [guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) to install Jekyll on your machine.

### Site Generation
To build build the site from source code run:
``` 
cd src
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

To build and deploy the site locally, run:
``` 
cd src
bundle exec jekyll serve
```


<!--
The site is currently built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using the [Phantom](https://github.com/jamigibbs/phantom) theme.

## Developing


### Setup
Clone this repo. Run the following on terminal:
```
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Site Generation
Run the following
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Running this generates the site's source code in the `/doc` folder, and hosts the site locally.

### Deploying to Github Pages
Since Github pages doesn't support all of Jekyll's plugins all that well, we'll need to manually perform the bundling to deploy our updated site.
This repo is currently set up to serve files that are in the `/doc` folder.
